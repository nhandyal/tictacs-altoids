// I think this is solved...
Figure out a way to get waitOn to work with routes. It's adds bullshit complexity
in the template logic.

--> Meteor animations seems to be another beast right now. Going to remove the animation
	code and get the app to work with pure reactive data. Then go back and add animations
	one by one

force templates to use the data context from a DB document or a route. Don't render
templates conditionally based on session store. Ideally Session store can be removed
and all "state" or "data" that needs to be passed around can be run via reactive hooks
into the db documents.
