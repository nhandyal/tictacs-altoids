Due to the way meteor loads files, all model declerations should go here.

Meteor load order is determined by: ((http://andrewscala.com/meteor/)
	1: Files in [project_root]/lib are loaded first.
	2: Files are sorted by directory depth. Deeper files are loaded first.
	3: Files are sorted in alphabetical order.
	4: main.* files are loaded last. These are nice for code that needs to be run after every other script and library has loaded.
	
	Meteor has some special directories that help you deal with breaking apart client/server code and deal with load order:
		[project_root]/lib/ - Files in this directory will get loaded before your client/server code starts.
		[project_root]/client/ - Files here are only sent to the client’s browser and aren’t available or run from the server.
		[project_root]/server/ - Files here are only run on the server and aren’t available on the client.
		[project_root]/public/ - Meteor serves static media from this directory. If you put image.jpg in here, feel free to refer to it directly as image.jpg in your html.
		[project_root]/.meteor/ - Meteor keeps special, project related info in here, like which modules you’ve installed. You really shouldn’t need to poke around in here.
